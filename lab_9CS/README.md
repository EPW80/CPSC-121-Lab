If you have questions let your instructor or the lab assistant know. You can also consult your classmates.

To get started on problem 1, change into the `prob01` directory. If you haven't already, change into the lab02 directory:

cd lab09-<YOUR_USERNAME>
```

Then change into the prob01 folder and view the README for its instructions:
